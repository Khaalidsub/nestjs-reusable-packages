</p>

<p align="center">A collection of reusable NestJS packages and libraries for building efficient and scalable applications.</p>

## Description

This repository contains multiple shareable NestJS packages designed to be easily integrated into your applications. Each package is built with TypeScript and follows NestJS best practices for modularity and dependency injection.

## Available Packages

### ðŸ“¦ Redis Stream Events (`libs/redis-stream-events`)

A comprehensive NestJS module for working with Redis Streams, providing both publishing and consuming capabilities with type-safe payloads.

**Features:**
- Type-safe event publishing with Zod schema validation
- Consumer groups and message acknowledgment
- Graceful connection handling and shutdown
- Easy dependency injection with decorators

**Quick Start:**
```typescript
@Module({
  imports: [
    RedisStreamsModule.forRoot({ url: 'redis://localhost:6379' }),
    RedisStreamsModule.register({ streamId: 'mystream' }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ pnpm install -g @nestjs/mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! If you'd like to add a new reusable package:

1. Create a new directory under `libs/`
2. Follow the existing structure and patterns
3. Add comprehensive documentation
4. Include usage examples in the `apps/examples` directory
5. Submit a pull request

## Future Packages

We're planning to add more reusable packages including:
- Database utilities
- Authentication helpers
